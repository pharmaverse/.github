## Contributions 

If you'd like to get involved with contributions, see options [here](https://pharmaverse.org/contribute/) or reach out to
any of our council reps (listed at the bottom of our homepage).

If you are a package lead or a new development team, you may find it useful to learn and re-use from some of the more
established pharmaverse packages. For example, the `{admiral}` family of packages shares a common set of developer
utility functions detailed [here](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldev/main/) and CI/CD workflow checks
[here](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiralci/main/). Many of these learnings were inherited from the NEST team,
and we are keen to help spread such efficiency techniques across our pharmaverse community. Read more about what's
available to help you [here](https://pharmaverse.org/contribute/lead/).

## Support

Our support model is explained [here](https://pharmaverse.org/support/) and very much relies on an active community
of engaged individuals from across our industry. Please join the community via our Slack workspace using this
[link](https://join.slack.com/t/pharmaverse/shared_invite/zt-yv5atkr4-Np2ytJ6W_QKz_4Olo7Jo9A).
