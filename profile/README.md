To get started with learning about the pharmaverse, please visit our [website](https://pharmaverse.org/) and check out our
pharma stack of open source R packages to enable clinical reporting [here](https://pharmaverse.org/e2eclinical/).

If you'd like to get involved with contributions, see options [here](https://pharmaverse.org/contribute/) or reach out to
any of our council reps (listed at the bottom of our homepage).

If you are a package lead or a new development team, you may find it useful to learn and re-use from some of the more
established pharmaverse packages. For example, the `{admiral}` family of packages shares a common set of developer
utility functions detailed [here](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldev/main/) and CI/CD workflow checks
[here](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiralci/main/). Many of these learnings were inherited from the NEST team,
and we are keen to help spread such efficiency techniques across our pharmaverse community.
